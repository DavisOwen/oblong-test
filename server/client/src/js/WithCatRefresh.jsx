/**
 * @todo:
 * Add necessary functionality to this function to accomplish the following:
 * 1. When component mounts, it should automatically request a new cat image
 *    from the api.
 * 2. The url of the current cat image should be passed down to the component
 *    being wrapped.
 * 3. Render a refresh button below the component we are wrapping that fetches
      a new cat image on click.
